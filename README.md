# Natural-Language-Processing

Welcome to my Natural Language Processing (NLP) Repository! This repository is a collection of various NLP projects and experiments I have worked on during my academic and professional journey. These projects showcase my understanding of various NLP concepts, techniques, and frameworks, such as sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, text classification, and deep learning models for text data.

## Introduction
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. This repository contains projects that demonstrate my skills in various NLP techniques, such as text preprocessing, feature extraction, word embeddings, and deep learning models for text data.

## Projects
Here's a list of some topics covered in this repository:

Text Classification with Word Embeddings: Creating text classifiers to categorize news articles into predefined categories using word embeddings as features and various machine learning models for classification.

Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) & Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Implementation: Building and training FNN and RNN models to perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews, showcasing the differences between the two architectures and their suitability for handling text data.

Hidden Markov Model POS Tagging: Implementing a Hidden Markov Model for part-of-speech tagging to assign POS tags to words in a given sentence, demonstrating the effectiveness of probabilistic models for sequence labeling tasks.

Perceptron Learning and Classification from Scratch: Developing a perceptron learning algorithm from scratch to classify text data, demonstrating a fundamental understanding of the perceptron algorithm and its application in NLP tasks.
